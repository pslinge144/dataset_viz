# dataset_viz

This project will attempt to be a simple data visualization tool for large images (several megabytes) along with annotations that will be displayed within imagery.

Some specific design constraints:
- minimal reliance on libraries outside of stock Anaconda install
- usage of SQLite database to reference image locations on disk along with relevant annotations
