# dataset_viz

This project will attempt to be a simple data visualization tool for large images (several megabytes) along with annotations that will be displayed within imagery.

Some specific design constraints:
- minimal reliance on libraries outside of stock Anaconda install
- usage of SQLite database to reference image locations on disk along with relevant annotations


Some references that could come in handy for building this application:
- Python Machine Learning: Perform Python Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- Tkinter GUI Application Development Cookbook
- Tkinter GUI Programming by Example
